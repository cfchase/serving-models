= Creating a workbench

A workbench is an instance of your development and experimentation environment. When you create a workbench, you select a workbench image (sometimes referred to as a notebook image) that is optimized with the tools and libraries that you need for developing models. 

.Prerequisites

* You created a `My Storage` connection as described in xref:storing-data-with-connections.adoc[Storing data with connections].


.Procedure

. Navigate to the project detail page for the data science project that you created in xref:setup/setting-up-your-data-science-project.adoc[Setting up your data science project].

. Click the *Workbenches* tab, and then click the *Create workbench* button.
